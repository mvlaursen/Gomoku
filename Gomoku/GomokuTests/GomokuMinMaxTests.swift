     Board initializer for setting up test scenarios.
     
     - Parameters:
       - moves: This list of Moves is applied to a board that starts out with
           `.empty` squares in the playable area, `.outofbounds` squares in the
           padding areas.
       - availableMoveIndices: It is OK to set up a set of available move
           indices that does not include every `.empty` space left on the
           board. It can be useful for testing to have only a few, one, or no
           choice of available moves. The initializer checks that all indices
           in `availableMoveIndices` refer to `.empty` squares.
